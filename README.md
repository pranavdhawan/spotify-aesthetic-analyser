# spotify-aesthetic-analyser

Web app that analyzes your Spotify listening habits and provides personalized music insights with a touch of humor. Get AI-powered analysis of your music taste, including compliments, jokes, and playful roasts based on your top tracks, artists, and playlists.

(I basically built it to test out [Trae.ai](https://www.trae.ai/) lol)

## Using it

- Login with your Spotify account to access your music data
- View your top artists, tracks, and playlists
- Get three different perspectives on your music taste:
  - Nice: Thoughtful compliments about your music choices
  - Funny: Humorous observations about your listening habits
  - Roast: Playful teasing about your music preferences
- Also added some personalized song suggestions based on your music taste

## What was used

- **Frontend**: React, TailwindCSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express
- **APIs**: Spotify Web API, OpenAI API
- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0
